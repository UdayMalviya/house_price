# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict house prices using a dataset from India. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to predict house prices based on various features.

## 📂 Project Structure

 ```
 house_price/
 │── House Price India.csv  # Dataset containing house price details
 │── house.ipynb            # Jupyter Notebook with data analysis & modeling
 │── README.md              # Project documentation (this file)
 ```

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset `House Price India.csv` contains various features that influence house prices. Some of the key attributes in the dataset are:

- **Location**: The city/region where the house is located.
- **Size**: Number of bedrooms (BHK).
- **Total Area**: The total area of the house in square feet.
- **Price**: The target variable (house price in INR).
- **Additional Features**: Includes Postal code, Renovation Year etc.

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The **house.ipynb** notebook covers:
- Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
- Feature Engineering
- Visualizations (Histograms, Scatter Plots, Correlation Matrix)
- Insights on house price trends

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

The notebook includes:
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model Evaluation (R² Score, MAE, RMSE)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

**Make sure you have python installed.**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UdayMalviya/house_price.git
   cd house_price
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open **house.ipynb** and run the cells.

## 📌 Usage

- Load the dataset and explore trends in house prices.
- Train different machine learning models to predict house prices.
- Modify or improve the model based on new data or better techniques.
